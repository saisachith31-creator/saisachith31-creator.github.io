      <h1>About SwiftShine</h1>

      <p>
        Traditional car washing methods often require large amounts of water,
        long waiting times, and access to proper washing areas.
        SwiftShine was developed to provide a simpler alternative — one that
        fits modern lifestyles while still delivering quality results.
      </p>

      <h3>Our Idea</h3>
      <p>
        We believe car care should be convenient, efficient, and environmentally
        responsible. SwiftShine focuses on waterless cleaning solutions that
        reduce waste while keeping vehicles looking their best.
      </p>

      <h3>Our Philosophy</h3>
      <p>
        Good design is simple. Our products are built around ease of use,
        minimal steps, and reliable performance — without unnecessary complexity.
      </p>
